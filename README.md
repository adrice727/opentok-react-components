# UX Components

OpenTok UX Components are built with:

 - [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)

You can preview components using [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).  Due to a current [issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4489) with `yarn`, it's recommended that you use `npm`.

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run storybook
```
You can view the storybook at `http://localhost:6006/`

*If you get an error regarding type declarations for a `css` file, you may need to run `npm run watch` in a separate terminal tab.*
